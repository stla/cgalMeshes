```

The **RcppCGAL** package now contains version 5.5.2 of the **CGAL** library. 
There is something new in this version: the *3D alpha wrapping*. This is a 
bit similar to the *3D alpha hull* but this can work better.

So I implemented the alpha wrapping in my package 
[cgalMeshes](https://github.com/stla/cgalMeshes) (currently it is only in the 
**github** branch of the repository).

To illustrate the alpha wrapping, I will take a pseudo-gyroid. It is an 
isosurface, and it is qualified as "pseudo" because the true gyroid has a 
more complicated isosurface equation. The pseudo-gyroid is an approximation 
of the gyroid.

```{r gyroid}
# the pseudo-gyroid is the isosurface f(x,y,z)=0
f <- function(x, y, z) {
  cos(x) * sin(y) + cos(y) * sin(z) + cos(z) * sin(x)
}
# construct the isosurface f=0
ngrid <- 70L
x <- y <- z <- seq(-5, 5, length.out = ngrid)
Grid <- expand.grid(X = x, Y = y, Z = z)
voxel <- array(
  with(Grid, f(X, Y, Z)), dim = c(ngrid, ngrid, ngrid)
)
library(rmarchingcubes)
contour_shape <- contour3d(
  griddata = voxel, level = 0, x = x, y = y, z = z
)
# make mesh
library(rgl)
rglMesh <- tmesh3d(
  vertices = t(contour_shape[["vertices"]]),
  indices  = t(contour_shape[["triangles"]]),
  normals  = contour_shape[["normals"]]
)
```

```r
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512))
view3d(-40, 35)
shade3d(rglMesh, color = "orange")


bdry <- getBoundary3d(rglMesh, color = "black", lwd = 3)
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512))
view3d(-40, 35)
shade3d(rglMesh, color = "orange")
shade3d(bdry)
```

Maybe adding the boundary to the plot is helpful for visualization:

```r
bdry <- getBoundary3d(rglMesh, color = "black", lwd = 3)
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512))
view3d(-40, 35)
shade3d(rglMesh, color = "orange")
shade3d(bdry)
```

![](./figures/pseudogyroid_cube_boundary.png)

This pseudo-gyroid is inscribed in the cube $(-5,5)\times(-5,5)\times(-5,5)$. 
I prefer the spherical pseudo-gyroid, obtained by clipping the cubical 
pseudo-gyroid to a sphere:

```{r clipping}
# returns the squared norms of the vertices
sqnorm <- function(vertices) { 
  apply(vertices, 1L, function(row) crossprod(row))
}
# clipping
rglMesh2 <- clipMesh3d(rglMesh, sqnorm, bound = 25, greater = FALSE)
# extract boundary
bdry <- getBoundary3d(rglMesh2, color = "black", lwd = 3)
```

```r
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512), zoom = 0.7)
shade3d(rglMesh2, color = "orangered")
shade3d(bdry)
```

![](./figures/pseudogyroid_sphere.png)

This mesh has $21371$ vertices and $40919$ triangles:

```{r print_rglMesh2}
rglMesh2
```

Let's extract its vertices:

```{r}
vertices <- t(rglMesh2$vb[-4L, ])
```

And now we will try to reconstruct the surface from its vertices only. 

The *advanced front surface reconstruction* fails:

```{r AFS}
library(cgalMeshes)
AFSmesh <- AFSreconstruction(vertices)
AFSmesh$computeNormals()
```

```r
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512), zoom = 0.7)
shade3d(AFSmesh$getMesh(), color = "red")
```

![](./figures/pseudogyroid_AFS.png)

The pseudo-gyroid does not bound a volume (it has no width), so the Poisson 
reconstruction cannot be applied.

Let's try the alpha hull.

```{r alphaHull}
library(AlphaHull3D)
ahull <- fullAhull3d(vertices)
amesh <- setAlpha(ahull, alpha = 1.8)
```

This value of $\alpha$ is both too big (we get some faces that shouldn't be 
there) and too small (we get some holes):

```r
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512), zoom = 0.7)
shade3d(amesh, color = "green")
```

![](./figures/pseudogyroid_alphaHull.png)

So there's no way.

Finally, the alpha wrapping comes to our rescue. The alpha wrapping depends 
on two parameters: 

- $\alpha$: the smallest $\alpha$, the smallest triangles in the output mesh;

- *offset*: the distance between the input and the output.

In the `alphaWrap` function, we give the relative $\alpha$ and the relative 
offset. Then $\alpha$ and the offset are both obtained by dividing the length 
of the diagonal of the bounding box of the vertices by their relative version.
You have to play with these parameters to get a nice mesh. A too small $\alpha$ 
yields some holes in the mesh, and the mesh has less details when $\alpha$ 
increases.

```{r alphaWrapping}
wrapMesh <- alphaWrap(vertices, ralpha = 100, roffset = 1000) 
wrapMesh$computeNormals()
```

```r
wrapRglMesh <- wrapMesh$getMesh()
open3d(windowRect = 50 + c(0, 0, 512, 512), zoom = 0.7)
shade3d(wrapRglMesh, color = "orangered")
```

![](./figures/pseudogyroid_wrapped.png)

Note that we cannot add the boundary to this mesh: it has no boundary. It has 
a width, controlled by the offset parameter.
